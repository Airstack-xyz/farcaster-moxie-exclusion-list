# Accounts excluded from Moxie Protocol everyday rewards
A public repository with Farcaster accounts which are excluded from giving or earning Moxie. You can find the list in the json file [here](https://github.com/Airstack-xyz/farcaster-bots/blob/main/farcaster-bots.json).

Majority of the accounts are automatically flagged by our system, which is trying to identify bot-like behavior and farming activities.

If you think your account has been flagged by mistake, you can raise a PR or an issue with the account details. 

## Only PRs/issues following the criteria will be reviewed:

1. Account FID: 2602

2. Moxie Protocol TVL: 113,237 MOXIE (can be found on Airstack's website, preferably a screenshot)

3. Comment why the account should be unflagged

If any of the above information is missing the PR/Issue will be closed.
